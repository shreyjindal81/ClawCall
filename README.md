# ClawCall

Make real AI-powered phone calls from any AI agent. ClawCall dials US phone numbers, handles the conversation, and returns the outcome, transcript, and recording when available.

**30 calls and 30 minutes free, whichever lasts later. No credit card required.**

## Hosted MCP connector (recommended)

ClawCall's official remote MCP server is available at:

```text
https://api.clawcall.dev/mcp
```

Add that URL as a custom connector in Grok Build, ChatGPT, Claude, Codex, or another remote MCP client. The connector uses OAuth 2.1: sign in to ClawCall and approve read/write call access when prompted. No API key is copied into the AI host.

The hosted connector can:

- place outbound calls to US phone numbers
- navigate phone menus and hold queues
- bridge the user into a live call
- poll call status and retrieve transcripts and temporary recording URLs
- list inbound and outbound call history
- end active calls and inspect plan or trial usage
- serve ClawCall's calling guide before a call is placed

The Grok Build plugin source is in [`grok/`](./grok). Its official xAI marketplace submission is tracked in [xai-org/plugin-marketplace#336](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace/pull/336).

## Agent skill

Install the ClawCall skill from ClawHub:

```bash
openclaw skills install clawcall-dev
```

Published skill: https://clawhub.ai/clawcall-dev/clawcall-dev

Or manually add [`skill/SKILL.md`](./skill/SKILL.md) and its bundled references to your agent's skills directory. The skill uses ClawCall's REST API and persists its low-privilege API key locally.

## Legacy local stdio MCP package

The [`mcp/`](./mcp) directory contains the legacy `@clawcall/mcp` stdio package for existing local/API-key installations. New integrations should use the hosted OAuth connector above. The legacy package remains documented for compatibility but is not the distribution path submitted to the xAI marketplace.

## What it does

- Calls US phone numbers over real phone lines
- Handles appointments, reservations, order checks, callbacks, office follow-ups, phone menus, and hold queues
- Leaves voicemail or takes messages when instructed
- Returns call outcomes, transcripts, and recordings
- Supports live handoff when identity verification, negotiation, or a real-time decision requires the user
- Supports reusable voice, personality, greeting, and inbound reserved-number answering preferences through the product and REST surfaces

## Examples

> "Call Dr. Rivera's office and confirm my appointment for Tuesday at 2:30."

> "Phone the restaurant at +15551234567 and make a reservation for four people Saturday at 7 PM."

> "Get me through to a real person at my insurance company."
